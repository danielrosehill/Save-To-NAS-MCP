# Local MCP for Repetitive Tasks

I'd like to create a local MCP for use on this computer essentially. And the task of the MCP is going to be just doing a repetitive task which is asking an AI tool to save an output information onto my local NAS.

The NAS is a Synology NAS available at 10.0.0.50, and it has a specific volume structure. It's available through NFS. The mounts are all visible if you pull the NFS.

And what I'd like to do really is just have everything defined in the MCP, so I can say save this folder to either a volume that I think rather rather than define the volumes, which are always going to be changing and create a lot of tool bloat with tools for create new volumes, delete volumes, edit volumes. I just want one that is for moving data over the local network to the NAS and giving it that background, so it knows it's going to be these are NFS shared. This is where they are in Synology. This is how to list the mounts.

Do that, find them, and also knowing that they're mounted locally on my computer. So in the first instance, see if that volume is mounted.

If not, look for it on the on the network and move the data over there. So I don't need to have to walk it through all these steps every single time.
